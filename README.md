my first obsidian app, neat. this is a simple little app that adds a status bar buddy - a 56x56 image, including gifs! - to the end of your status bar.

the default in my character dizzy (isn't she a cutie?) but if you're a hater you can change it to whatever you'd like. for the moment, the plugin can't use local files and obsidian must be reloaded between buddy src changes - both things i intend to fix as we go.
